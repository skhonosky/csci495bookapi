# csci495bookapi

a.     Description / Purpose - 
          My WebAPI focuses on pulling information from an extrenal database using REST Web Services. I created this WebAPI using C# in Microsoft VS Code. The purpose of my program is to add an organized way to 
 document books in a database. You can add a book's title, author, genre, and release year. Alongside this, you can also update existing books, delete existing books, and retreive existing data from the database.

b.     Dependencies - 
          Postman (aids with Get, Post, Put, and Delete)
          MySqlWorkbench (implements the database)

c.     Usage - 
          This program can be used to Get book information from a database, Update book information in a database, Insert boook information into a database, and Delete book information from a database.

d.     Future Work - 
          In the future, I would hope that this program would be able to shift into a more user friendly version where someone might be able to keep track of books they've read, possibly review them, and rate them.

e.     What is your major and how this project is related to your major. - 
          I am double majoring in Nursing and Information Systems, and this project is related to my major because it focuses on working with databases, including retrieving information from them, modifying information in them, and inserting information into them.
